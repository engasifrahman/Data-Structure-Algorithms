#                                 What is Queue                                #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, 
where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

#                           Basic Operations of Queue                          #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
A queue is an object (an abstract data structure - ADT) that allows the following operations:

Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
IsFull: Check if the queue is full
Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

#                             Limitations of Queue                             #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
After a bit of enqueuing and dequeuing, the size of the queue has been reduced.

#                              Complexity Analysis                             #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
The complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue using an array is O(1).

#                             Applications of Queue                            #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
- CPU scheduling, Disk scheduling
- When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes. The queue is used for synchronization. For example: IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc
- Handling of interrupts in real-time systems.
- Call center phone systems use Queues to hold people calling them in order.
